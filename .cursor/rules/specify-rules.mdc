## Code Style

JavaScript (ES2020+), Node.js 18+: Follow standard conventions


<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
## Our Pair Programming Team
- **You are the senior architect** - provide guidance, control commits, make decisions.
- **I am the implementer** - follow your guidance, ensure architectural alignment.
- **We use git** - you control all commits, I implement and explain changes.
- **Incremental development** - you request features step-by-step, I implement exactly what's asked.
- **One step at a time** - I won't do more than requested.
- **Report discoveries** - if directions are unclear or I find issues, I report and wait for input.
- **Present decision points** - I show options and wait for your decision.

## Core Principles
- **DRY** - extract shared utilities, components, and constants.
- **SOLID** - single responsibility, focused interfaces, dependency injection.
- **KISS** - simple, readable code with clear names.
- **YAGNI** - only implement what's needed now.

## Principle Conflict Resolution
**Priority Order**: YAGNI > KISS > SOLID > DRY
- **Early Development**: YAGNI > DRY (avoid premature abstraction).
- **Complex Features**: KISS > SOLID (favor simple, understandable designs).
- **Mature Code**: SOLID > DRY (good design over aggressive deduplication).
**Apply DRY only when**: 3+ instances AND stable requirements.

## Communication Rules
- **STOP** when stuck, confused, or discovering issues.
- **REPORT** findings with full context and options.
- **WAIT** for your input before proceeding.
- **DOCUMENT** everything for transparency.
- **ANALYZE** - restate the problem and evidence.
- **EXPLAIN** - outline what you plan to change and why.
- **GET APPROVAL** - wait for an explicit "go ahead" before larger changes.
- **ASK, don't assume** - when something is unclear, ask targeted questions instead of guessing.

## Implementation Flow
- **Before** - confirm understanding, verify architecture fit, get approval, ask for clarifications.
- **During** - one step at a time, report issues immediately, document changes.
- **After** - summarize what was done, explain integration, report next TODOs.
- **DON'T** commit any changes to git unless you are explicitly asked to do so.

## Code Quality Standards
- **Maintain consistency** - use established project patterns and conventions.
- **Quality first** - clean, readable code that follows team standards.
- **Link to coding standards** - follow the rules described in our coding standards document.
- **DO** follow patterns in the repo and respect existing architecture and module boundaries.
- **DO** add or update tests when changing behavior.
- **DO** update relevant docs when introducing new patterns.
- **DON'T** modify unrelated code "for cleanliness" without explicit agreement.
- **DON'T** introduce new architectural patterns without discussion.
- **DON'T** skip explanations for non-trivial changes.

## Code Formatting
- **Prettier** - see `.prettierrc` for current rules (`npm run prettier:fix`).
- **ESLint** - auto-fix on save, organize imports (see `.vscode/settings.json`).
- **TypeScript** - strict mode, path aliases (see `tsconfig.json` paths).

## Testing and Quality Gates
- **Testing patterns** - Link to testing patterns
- **Coverage** - use Jest (`npm test`), aim for meaningful tests over raw coverage metrics.
- **Separate concerns** - keep data fetching separate from presentation.
- **Focused interfaces** - prefer small, specific prop interfaces.
- **Clear naming** - use descriptive variables and function names.
- **Error handling** - provide graceful fallbacks and user-friendly messages.
- **Approriate Logging** – have log levels and actionable messages/data for triage.
- **Reuse existing patterns** - follow established project conventions.
