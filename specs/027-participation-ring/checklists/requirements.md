# Specification Quality Checklist: Live Participation Ring on Item Buttons

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The user provided an exceptionally detailed feature description that was pre-discussed in conversation, covering visual design, data flow, polling strategy, color treatment, accessibility, and scope boundaries. No clarifications were needed.
- Assumptions documented inline: 30-second polling cadence matches existing infrastructure; ring dimensions (68px SVG around 60px button) fit within the existing 24px grid gap; color-mix() browser support is sufficient for the target audience.
