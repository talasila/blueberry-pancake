# Data Model: Landing Page

**Feature**: Landing Page (002-landing-page)  
**Date**: 2025-01-27

## Overview

This feature is view-only and does not involve data persistence, storage, or data models. No entities, relationships, or data structures are required.

## Not Applicable

This feature does not:
- Store data
- Process user input (beyond display)
- Interact with backend APIs
- Manage application state beyond local UI state

## Local UI State

The component may use local React state for:
- Input field value (controlled input)
- Button hover/active states (handled via CSS)

These are transient UI states only and do not constitute a data model.
